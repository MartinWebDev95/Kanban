- **React:** I have used React as the project framework, creating different components, several contexts, different pages and several custom hooks. 

- **Supabase:** I have used Supabase for authentication through Google, authentication with the Demo User and to be able to do a CRUD with the different tables, task states, tasks and subtasks.

- **Tailwind CSS:** I have used TailwindCSS to style the different components.

- **React Router:** I have used React Router to create the different routes that the website has, since React does not have an integrated router like other frameworks.

- **React Hook Form:** I have used React Hook Form for validation of all forms as it reduces the amount of code you need to write while removing unnecessary re-renders.

- **Vite JS:** I have used Vite JS as a build tool.

- **ESLint:** I have used ESLint to follow the Airbnb style guide in the project code.
